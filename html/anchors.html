        <p><h1><a id="hypemachine"></a>HypeMachine</h1></p>
        <p>Back in the day, the original SX Multiscale was a thin bodied, bevelled edged 'super strat'. It's original 'strings over air' headstock was designed in '93, well before the first Ormsby was ever made.

            They were ideas. Ideas that were shared and improved upon. It evolved into something quite different. Hell, it inspired a bunch of builders to do their own take on things. At the time, reversed headstocks were not 'cool', Wenge necks were unheard of for an electric guitar, there was a jack located near the strap button of all places, and even carved tops were mostly reserved for 'old man guitars'.
            
            The Hypemachine takes a lot of those things away. No carved tops. No set necks. But it brings a bag of goodies too; exotic timbers from across the globe, innovative chambering patterns, and a neutral 'strapped on' feel. Light weight, but sounding heavy as can be. An industrial look, wrapped up in a blanket of silk.
            
            Hypemachines are only available to purchase as part of a 'run', announced approximately every nine months. During the production period, we offer an interest free monthly payment plan. All clients are invited to a 'secret' facebook group to discuss specifications, options, and allow you to view all updates in one central location. During the run, we also tend to have 'meet and greet' days, or 'try a hype' weekends. You'll be part of a growing community. MATERIALS
            An extensive list of materials for bodies, necks, and fretboards are offered to ensure your Hypemachine is a true one of a kind. The base materials for bodies are; Tasmanian Blackwood, Swamp Ash, Mahogany, with more available as an option. For necks we use Maple, Tasmanian Blackwood, with an extensive list of exotics specific to each run. Fretboard standard materials are Ebony and Rosewood, with around 10-15 others offered within the run.
            
            DIMENSIONS
            The fanned arrangement of the Multiscale fretboard creates scale lengths for each individual string. We generally call this the "spread". For Hypemachiness, the spread is as follows:
            Six string: 25.5" or 25.5" - 27.5" Multiscale
            Seven string: 27" or 25.5" - 27.8" Multiscale
            Eight String: 27" or 25.5" - 28.2" Multiscale
            Due to the increased scale length on the bass side, the tension of the strings increases. We recommend you try dropping a gauge on the bottom end, for example, if you usually use 9-46's, try 9-42's.
            
            The bodies are thinner than you may be used to, at 38mm. This is still thick enough to accommodate the deeper push/pull potentiometers used for coil splitting pickups, and allows for more resonance than thicker bodies. FEEL
            The proprietary chambering in each Hypemachine creates a light weight, extremely resonant instrument. We expand on that with custom neck shapes to suit your preference. With an extended upper horn, expect a well balance neutral feel when standing.
            All fretwork is stainless steel, in a variety of sizes, which offers the ultimate in not only feel (it is seriously smooth!), but longevity also. Stainless steel frets tend to last three times longer, giving you piece of mind and confidence that your dream guitar will last a lifetime.
            
            HARDWARE
            The bridges are custom made for us to exacting tolerances by Hipshot USA. These bridges are made only for Ormsby Guitars and our specific multiscale layout.
            
            Machine screw and neck inserts are standard, which offer more than three times the strength of regular bolt-on neck screws. Sperzel, Hipshot, or Gotoh machineheads are standard, and hardware can be coloured either chrome, black, or gold.
            
            TONE
            Our unique chambering helps not only lower the strapped on weight of a Hypemachine, but increased the mids and gives a more percussive attack to the bottom end. With our standard and custom range of pickups at your disposal, we can shape each Hypemachine's tone into whatever you fancy.
            
            FINISH
            As standard, Hypemachines have our six coat oil system. Hand rubbed, and very thin, the oil protects your Hypemachine against moisture and humidity changes whilst giving it a nice earthly feel. We do also offer a lacquer in both full gloss, and gloss/satin. PRICING
            Hypemachines start at $2850 AUD, with the average order being roughly $4400 AUD by the time your selected exotic timbers, binding, Multiscale fretboard, and all the fancy stuff are added to make it really unique. A small deposit secures your position in the run, with a payment plan of only $250 per month while your guitar is built. Once completed, you will be requested to pay the final remaining payments prior to shipping. There is no upcharge penalty for left handed players. Nice, huh?

        <p>The SX is the mainstay of Ormsby Guitars. First released in 2008 as a Multiscale, it was a hit from the start. Excellent fret access, compact body, and an upper horn that extends out to the 12th fret provide a beautifully balance guitar.

           The SX is our most customised model: Multiscale or Regular fretboards, carved, bent or flat tops, six, seven and even eight string configurations, and an almost unlimited list of timbers both exotic and domestic, give you the scope to really fine tune your guitar into something you've only ever dreamed of.
